# Sources of Inspiration

- **Flappy Bird Game**: The addictive gameplay and simple mechanics of the original Flappy Bird game inspired us to create our version with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Classic Arcade Games**: Drawing from the charm and simplicity of classic arcade games like Space Invaders and Pac-Man, we aimed to capture a similar retro gaming experience in our project.
- **Online Tutorials and Resources**: We extensively utilized online tutorials, articles, and resources on game development, JavaScript programming, and HTML5 canvas animation to enhance our understanding and implementation.

# Computer Graphics Course

- **Core Studies**: Our computer graphics course provided a solid foundation in graphics programming concepts, including rasterization, transformations, and collision detection algorithms.
- **2D Graphics Understanding**: Through the course, we gained insights into 2D graphics principles, which were instrumental in creating visually appealing game elements such as sprites and backgrounds.
- **Animation Techniques**: Learning animation techniques helped us implement smooth animations for the bird, pipes, and other game components, enhancing the overall gaming experience.

# Building the Project

- **Collaboration**: We collaborated closely with team members, dividing tasks efficiently and leveraging each other's strengths to bring different aspects of the project to fruition.
- **Prototyping**: Before implementation, we created prototypes and mockups to visualize the game's layout, mechanics, and user interface, ensuring a clear direction for development.
- **Iterative Development**: We adopted an iterative approach, continuously testing, gathering feedback, and refining the game to improve gameplay mechanics and user experience iteratively.
- **Version Control**: Version control systems like Git and GitHub played a crucial role in managing project files, facilitating collaboration, and enabling seamless integration of new features and fixes.

# Flappy Bird Game Project

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game Project! üê¶üéÆ

## Introduction

This project aims to recreate the classic Flappy Bird game using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Flappy Bird is an addictive arcade-style game where the player controls a bird, guiding it through a series of pipes without hitting them. The objective is to navigate the bird through the pipes as far as possible to achieve the highest score.

## Features

- Simple Controls: Use the spacebar, up arrow key, or "X" key to control the bird's altitude.
- Scoring System: Earn points for successfully passing through each set of pipes.
- Collision Detection: Accurate collision detection ensures that the game ends when the bird collides with the pipes or the ground.
- Restart Mechanism: Restart the game by pressing specific keys after a collision to continue playing without refreshing the page.

## Development Phases

1. **Storyboard Design**: Develop a detailed storyboard outlining the flow of the project.
2. **Resource Gathering**: Gather all necessary resources, including graphics for the bird, pipes, and background.
3. **Game Mechanics Implementation**: Implement core game mechanics such as bird movement and collision detection.
4. **User Input Handling**: Develop functionality to capture user input for controlling the bird's movement.
5. **Scoring System**: Create a scoring system that increases with each successful passage through a set of pipes.
6. **Animation Integration**: Integrate animations seamlessly with the HTML canvas for a more immersive gaming experience.

## Introduction
In this project, we have created a simplified version of the popular Flappy Bird game using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Restart Mechanism**: After a collision, players can restart the game by pressing specific keys, enhancing the user experience and maintaining the game's flow.

## Technologies Used
